## 📝 Project Description
The **Library Management System** is a console-based application developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts in C++**.  
It helps manage library books and student transactions such as **issuing and returning books**.

This project demonstrates proper use of:
- Encapsulation  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Abstraction  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Manage books in a library  
- Issue and return books to students  
- Maintain book availability status  
- Restrict maximum number of books per student  
- Apply OOPS concepts in a real-world scenario

## 🧱 OOPS Concepts Used

| OOPS Concept | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Encapsulation | Data members are private and accessed via methods |
| Inheritance | `Student` class inherits from `User` |
| Polymorphism | Function overriding using `virtual` keyword |
| Abstraction | `Transaction` class hides issue/return logic |
